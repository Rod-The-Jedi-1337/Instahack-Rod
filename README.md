# Instahack-Rod
Prior version of Instahack that works for Jedis better than new version.
1. Download the tool:
      git clone https://github.com/Rod-The-Jedi-1337/Instahack-Rod

2.  In Termux or Kali, type:
      cd Instahack-Rod
      ls
      unzip Instahack-Rod.zip
      cat README.md
      chmod +x  insta.sh
      ./insta.sh
3. In a separate Termux or Kali Linux window, start Tor:
          tor
When Tor is 100% bootstrapped, return to Instahack-Rod window, amd type:
          ./insta.sh
Enter victim username, the PATH to a password list ( or just passwords.txt as default list).
    Finally, enter 10 as the number of threads, and hit enter key to start hacking.

    If the account password is not found, simply try again with a different password list.
